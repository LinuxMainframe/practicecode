# Challenge 17: Write tests for your utilities


Test cases for check_port():
1. Test open port (mock socket connection)
2. Test closed port
3. Test timeout
4. Test invalid host
5. Test invalid port (negative, > 65535)

Write 5 test functions that cover all cases

    def test_open_port(self):
        # Your test here
